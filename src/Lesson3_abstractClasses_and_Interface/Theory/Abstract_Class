What is an abstract class?
-> We cannot instantiate an abstract class.
-> we can not create a object of an abstract class

PURPOSE:
Generally it is used as a base class for other classes to provide a common definition
that multiple derived classes can share.

SUPPORT 2 TYPES OF METHODS:
1. abstract method                           2. Non-abstract method/concrete methods
-> which do not have an implementation,      -> which have implementation which means logic
   only signature

A class can only extend single abstract class in java
