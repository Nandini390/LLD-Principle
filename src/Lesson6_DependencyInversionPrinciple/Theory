Dependency Inversion Principle:-
High level module should not depend on low level module.
                     OR
Instead of depending on concrete classes you should depend on abstraction.

In very simple words, your main logic should not be tightly tied to how things are done. It should only care what needs to be done, not how it is done. The “how” part can change without breaking the system.

Think of a switch and a bulb. The switch does not directly depend on a specific bulb. It depends on the idea of “something that can be turned on or off.” Because of this, you can change the bulb anytime without changing the switch. This is exactly what DIP wants in software.

//**** Dependency Injection is a way to implement the Dependency Inversion.
